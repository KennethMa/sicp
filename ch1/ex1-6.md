`Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded.`

``` scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

To evaluate an `if` expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating the <predicate> part of the expression. If the <predicate> evaluates to a true value, the interpreter then evaluates the <consequent> and returns its value. Otherwise it evaluates the <alternative> and returns its value.

The `new-if` is evaluated by the interpreter with `applicative-order`.
